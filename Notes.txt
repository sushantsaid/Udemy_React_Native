(#) Getting started with React NATIVE

(1) Install React Native Development Tools

-> npm install -g create-react-native-app
OR
-> yarn global add create-react-native-app

(2) Scaffolding an Application
-> create-react-native-app <appname>

(3) Give access to Expo SDK

!!!!!!!!!!!(create-react-native-app is deprecated and its has been merged with expo)!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So use expo-cli for creating the projects

(1) Install expo-cli
-> yarn global add expo-cli

(2) Create project
-> expo init projectName

(3) Run the project
-> cd projectName
-> expo start
This will start the expo development server and the expo developer options 
use "Expo Client" app to run the app on device else use emulator

(#) Developing React Native App

# Basic elements of RNA : React Native Components and React Native Elements

-> Components 
    // Similar to React Components
    // Have state,props,JSX same as React

-> Elements
    // All-in-one UI kit for creating apps
    // Has many useful and ready-to-use Components

    Installation : yarn add react-native-elements


# Navigation using React Navigation
-> Built-in navigators : Stack, Drawer, Tab, Switch

-> Installation : yarn add react-navigation 
                            OR 
                npm install --save react-navigation
    -Then also install following packages:  expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
    
    -For version 4 also add the following package: yarn add react-navigation-stack

    To improve efficiency of navigation in Android(using Fragments) and IOS(using UIViewController) install following package:
    This allows react native to use native optimized navigation components for performance improvement
        expo install react-native-screens
    expo install will determine and install compatible version of package

#Configuring header using external package:
    -> Use following package to use buttons,icons,etc. in the header:
